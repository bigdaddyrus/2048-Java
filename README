Makefile               For those of you using the standard Unix tool chain
                       rather than Eclipse, this file provides for some
                       simple compilation/testing control.  See the 
                       comments in it for the targets provided.  Those of
                       you using Eclipse will need it on the instructional
                       machines (the commands 'make' and 'make check' must
                       work correctly on your submission, regardless of
                       which editor or IDE you used).

staff-version          If we update the skeleton, this file will contain a
                       unique version id indicating what version of the
                       skeleton is currently in use.
